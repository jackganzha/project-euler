# What is Project Euler?

_quoting from project euler home page_

[Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/) is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming [problems](http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems) that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.

# What about the solutions?

I will try to solve the problems using mainly Ruby and Java. Eventually, I can pick another language, just for fun. Each problem will have its own readme file, with instructions about how to execute the solution.

# Running

You will need:

 * Ruby 1.8.x or 1.9.x - you can install using [RVM](http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/)
 * Bundler - <http://gembundler.com/>

## All solutions together

Just type the following commands in the project root directory:

    >> bundle install
    >> rake

All the specs, for all the problems, will run.

## An especific problem

    >> cd problemX
    >> bundle install
    >> rake

TADA! That is it.
